# OWL-EDA
One of my favorite hobbies is to play and watch Overwatch since the first year that it was launched.  
Now, as a data analyst I can clean, write, visualize, and get insights from the official dataset of the esports league.  

This EDA just include information about the `2022 Season`, although the league started in 2018.
As this year the format of the tournaments changed, and the game passed from a `6v6 to 5v5`.  
The EDA is focused in the map dataset `match_map_stats` and I will try to get insights about: 
* Total playtime ⏲
* Types of maps played 🗺
* Common scores 💯
* Reversed sweeps 🔀
* and more.
